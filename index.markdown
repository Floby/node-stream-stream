<p class="lead">
    <strong>node-stream-stream: </strong> A stream of streams in order to concatenate the contents of several streams
</p>

#### But why?

It may have all started from a question on StackOverflow where someone was trying to read
sequential log files in a unified fashion. I first created [node-catstream](http://projects.flo.by/node-catstream)
but then realized I could make something more general

I advise you read the [Readme]({{ site.url }}/readme) file. It really is not that complicated.

#### Current state
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Floby/node-stream-stream.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Floby/node-stream-stream)

**node-stream-stream** is part of my first experimentations with the new Stream2 API in Node.js 0.10
